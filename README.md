# Word-Association-Web 🌐✨  

## About  
**Word-Association-Web** is a creative brainstorming sandbox that helps you map out your ideas and see how they connect. Whether you're planning a project, exploring concepts, or just letting your thoughts flow, this tool is here to visualize your mental web of associations.  

I created this to build a space where my ideas could come to life—showing how they interrelate and form meaningful connections. It's like a brainstorming playground for your brain! 🧠💡  

## How It Works  
This app was built using modern web technologies like **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It's a lightweight, fast, and intuitive space for idea exploration. The app communicates with a small Express server that handles requests to OpenAI.
